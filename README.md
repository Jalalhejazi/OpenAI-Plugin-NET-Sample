# OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin - NET Pets Sample

_Create, customize and deploy your own ChatGPT PlugIn in minutes._ ‚ú®

This is a quickstart for sample for creating [ChatGPT Plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) programing in NET, using GitHub Codespaces, VS Code, and Azure. 

To gain access to ChatGPT plugins, [join waitlist here](https://openai.com/waitlist/plugins)!

## Getting started (coming soon!)

1. **üì§ One-click setup**: [Open a new Codespace](https://codespaces.new/azure-samples/openai-plugin-fastapi), giving you a fully configured cloud developer environment.
2. **ü™Ñ Make an API**: Add routes in `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs`. Check [Route Handlers in Minimal API apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/route-handlers?view=aspnetcore-7.0) for more information.
3. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run, one-click again**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded port *8000* in your browser.
4. **üí¨ Test in ChatGPT**: Copy the URL (make sure its public) and paste it in ChatGPT's [Develop your own plugin](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/debugging) flow.
5. **üîÑ Iterate quickly:** Codespaces updates the server on each save, and VS Code's debugger lets you dig into the code execution.

## Run Local
1. Open `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs`. Press [F5] To Start Debugging. Choose your prefered Debugger.
1. Once the project is compiled, the app should be running. A new browser will open with the URL [http://localhost:5100/swagger/index.html].

1. Open ChatGPT. Select `GPT-4`, open the PlugIn Options. Open the PlugIn Store and select [Develop your own plugin]
    ![Develop your own plugin in PlugIn Store](/images/02chatgptpluginstore.png "Develop your own plugin in PlugIn Store")

1. Type [http://localhost:5100], and select [Find Manifest File]. ChatGPT will search for the manifest file at [http://localhost:5100/.well-known/ai-plugin.json] and load the plugin information. Select [Install LocalHost PlugIn]
    ![Test plugin manifest information found](/images/03foundpluginforlocalstore.png "Test plugin manifest information found")

1. The PlugIn will now be enabled in ChatGPT

1. We can now test the plug in. ChatGPT will use the Pet plugin for pets related questions
    1. Sample Question, "Who owns the oldest Pet?"
    ![Who owns the oldest pet?](/images/05oldestpets.png "Who owns the oldest pet?")
    
    1. Sample Question, "Who has more than one pet?"
    ![Who has more than one pet?](/images/06morethan1pet.png "Who has more than one pet?")


## Test in ChatGPT

You can use the following prompts to test the plugin in ChatGPT:

- How many cats are in the db?
- List the cat names in the catalog
- What info is needed to add a new pet?
- OK, let's add a new pet. His name is Net, is a calico breed, 17-year-old brown cat. He weighs 3 kilograms. His owner is Bruno Capuano, with the same owner information that you have in the database.


## Run in Codespaces (Coming Soon!)
1. Click here to open in GitHub Codespaces

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=lightgrey&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/elbruno/OpenAI-Plugin-NET-Sample)

1. This action may take a couple of minutes. Once the Codespaces is initialized, check the Extensions tab and check that all extensions are installed.

    **ToDo ADD IMAGE** 

1. Using the  the ***Explorer*** option, open the file `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs`.

    **ToDo ADD IMAGE**
