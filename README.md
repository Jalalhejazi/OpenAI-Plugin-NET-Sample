# OpenAI ChatGPT Plugin - NET Pets Sample

_Create, customize and deploy your own ChatGPT PlugIn in minutes._ ‚ú®

This is a quickstart for sample for creating [ChatGPT Plugin](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins) programing in NET, using GitHub Codespaces, VS Code, and Azure.

## Getting started

1. **üì§ One-click setup**: [Open a new Codespace](https://codespaces.new/azure-samples/openai-plugin-fastapi), giving you a fully configured cloud developer environment.
2. **ü™Ñ Make an API**: 
    
    Add routes in `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs`.     
    Check [Route Handlers in Minimal API apps](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/fundamentals/minimal-apis/route-handlers?view=aspnetcore-7.0) for more information.

3. **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run, one-click again**: Use VS Code's built-in *Run* command and open the forwarded port *5001* in your browser.
4. **üí¨ Test in ChatGPT**: Copy the URL (make sure its public) and paste it in ChatGPT's [Develop your own plugin](https://platform.openai.com/docs/plugins/getting-started/debugging) flow. Check the prompts example section below.  
5. **üîÑ Iterate quickly:** Codespaces updates the server on each save, and VS Code's debugger lets you dig into the code execution.

## Run Local
1. Open `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs`. Press [F5] To Start Debugging. Choose your prefered Debugger.
1. Once the project is compiled, the app should be running. A new browser will open with the URL [http://localhost:5100/swagger/index.html].

1. Open ChatGPT. Select `GPT-4`, open the PlugIn Options. Open the PlugIn Store and select [Develop your own plugin]
    ![Develop your own plugin in PlugIn Store](/images/02chatgptpluginstore.png "Develop your own plugin in PlugIn Store")

1. Type [http://localhost:5100], and select [Find Manifest File]. ChatGPT will search for the manifest file at [http://localhost:5100/.well-known/ai-plugin.json] and load the plugin information. Select [Install LocalHost PlugIn]

1. The PlugIn will now be enabled in ChatGPT

1. We can now test the plug in. ChatGPT will use the Pet plugin for pets related questions
    1. Sample Question, "Who owns the oldest Pet?"
    ![Who owns the oldest pet?](/images/05oldestpets.png "Who owns the oldest pet?")
    
    1. Sample Question, "Who has more than one pet?"
    ![Who has more than one pet?](/images/06morethan1pet.png "Who has more than one pet?")

## Run in Codespaces

1. Click here to open in GitHub Codespaces

    [![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?style=for-the-badge&label=GitHub+Codespaces&message=Open&color=lightgrey&logo=github)](https://codespaces.new/elbruno/OpenAI-Plugin-NET-Sample)

1. This action may take a couple of minutes. Once the Codespaces is initialized, check the Extensions tab and check that all extensions are installed.

1. The file `src/OpenAI.PlugIn.NETSample/Program.cs` should be open. If not, open it using the ***Explorer*** option from the Right Sidebar.

1. Using the  the ***Run and Debug*** option, run the program. Select "C# as the run option".

1. Open Codespaces Ports tab. Select the running instance for the local debug using port 5001, right click, and make it public.

    ![Make port 5001 public](/images/22makeportpublic.png "Make port 5001 public")

1. Copy the Codespaces address for port 8000. It should be similar to this one: 

    ```bash
    https://elbruno-laughing-palm-tree-wggg7q9qx93v4g-5100.preview.app.github.dev/
    ```

1. Open Chat GPT and add the plugin with the Codespaces address

    ![Copy run and debug url](/images/25chatgptcodespacesdebugurl.png "Copy run and debug url")

1. Open Chat GPT and add the plugin with the Codespaces address

    ![Install a new plugin using the run and debug url](/images/26pluginfound.png "Install a new plugin using the run and debug url")

1. Confirm the security questions and you are ready, the plugin is installed and ready to use in ChatGPT.

## Test in ChatGPT

You can use the following prompts to test the plugin in ChatGPT:

- How many cats are in the db?
- List the cat names in the catalog
- What info is needed to add a new pet?
- OK, let's add a new pet. His name is Net, is a calico breed, 17-year-old brown cat. He weighs 3 kilograms. His owner is Bruno Capuano, with the same owner information that you have in the database.
- Who owns the oldest Pet?
- Who has more than one pet?
